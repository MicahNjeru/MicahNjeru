<h1 align="center"> Hi there 👋🏾, I'm Micah Njeru!</h1>

<h2 align="center">A passionate iOS Software Engineer fueled by Kaizen.</h2>

I'm a coder who thrives on continuous improvement, inspired by the concept of Kaizen. My coding style prioritizes simplicity, readability, and clear comments to express my thought process. 

`"The first consumer of your code is you, so write code you or anyone else can read."` - Ringa.

My passion lies in bringing ideas to life by manipulating the output device (visual or audio) to perfectly express my vision. It's like creating a portal into my mind!
